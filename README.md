# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Model
I am analyzing a UCI dataset previously used in a study that applied machine learning to predict the presence of breast cancer. The original paper employed three classification methods—logistic regression, support vector machines, and random forests—achieving sensitivity between 82%-88% and specificity between 85%-90%. My goal is to replicate these results by implementing the same methods and evaluating whether similar performance metrics are obtained. Additionally, I will conduct an in-depth analysis to explore why certain variables contribute more effectively to the model's outcomes.
